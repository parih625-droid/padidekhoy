# Security Guidelines

This document outlines the security measures implemented in this application and provides guidelines for maintaining a secure deployment.

## Implemented Security Measures

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT Tokens**: Secure token-based authentication with expiration
- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt with 12 salt rounds
- **Rate Limiting**: Protection against brute force attacks
- **Input Validation**: Express-validator for all user inputs
- **CORS Protection**: Restricted cross-origin requests

### 2. Data Protection
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Using parameterized queries
- **XSS Prevention**: Input sanitization and output encoding
- **File Upload Security**: Type validation and size limits
- **Environment Variables**: Sensitive data stored in environment variables

### 3. API Security
- **Helmet.js**: Security headers for Express
- **Rate Limiting**: API request throttling
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation for all endpoints

### 4. Database Security
- **Parameterized Queries**: Prevention of SQL injection
- **Secure Connections**: Environment-based database credentials
- **Least Privilege**: Database user with minimal required permissions

## Security Recommendations

### 1. Production Deployment
- Change all default passwords and credentials
- Use strong, randomly generated secrets for JWT
- Configure proper SSL/HTTPS certificates
- Restrict CORS to only trusted domains
- Remove development logging in production

### 2. Database Security
- Use a dedicated database user with minimal privileges
- Regular database backups
- Enable database encryption at rest
- Use database connection pooling

### 3. Application Security
- Regular dependency updates and security audits
- Implement logging and monitoring
- Use a Web Application Firewall (WAF)
- Regular security testing and penetration testing

### 4. Network Security
- Use a reverse proxy (Nginx) with proper configuration
- Implement proper firewall rules
- Use secure network protocols
- Regular security scans

## Environment Variables Security

Never commit sensitive environment variables to version control. Use the following practices:

1. Create a `.env` file locally (not committed to git)
2. Set environment variables in your deployment platform
3. Use different values for development and production
4. Rotate secrets regularly

## Admin Account Security

The default admin account should be changed immediately in production:
- Change the default password
- Use a strong, unique password
- Consider implementing two-factor authentication
- Limit admin access to trusted users only

## Regular Security Maintenance

1. **Dependency Updates**: Regularly update npm packages
2. **Security Audits**: Run `npm audit` to check for vulnerabilities
3. **Penetration Testing**: Regular security assessments
4. **Monitoring**: Implement logging and alerting for suspicious activities
5. **Backups**: Regular data backups with secure storage
