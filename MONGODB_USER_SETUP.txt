# MongoDB User Setup Instructions for E-commerce Application

## Steps to create the required MongoDB user:

1. Connect to MongoDB shell:
   mongo

2. Switch to the ecommerce_db database:
   use ecommerce_db

3. Create the user with the following command:
   db.createUser({
     user: "padidekhoy",
     pwd: "Re1317821Za",
     roles: [
       { role: "readWrite", db: "ecommerce_db" },
       { role: "dbAdmin", db: "ecommerce_db" }
     ]
   })

4. Exit MongoDB shell:
   exit

5. Restart your backend server to test the connection:
   - Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
   - Start it again with: npm run start

## Verification:
After creating the user, you can test the connection by visiting:
http://87.107.12.71:5000/api/health

The health check should now return a successful response instead of "Something went wrong!".
